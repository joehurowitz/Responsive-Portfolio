       <img src="assets/images/JoeLandscape1.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">
 
       <p>My name is Joe Hurowitz. I've been a musician and school teacher for many years. I teach music in an elementary school in Washington DC and my daughter Madeleine is 11 years old. I sing and play guitar, piano and bass in a band called "The Mercy Alliance".
      I have played all over the world with some great bands and I've travelled every corne rof this country performing live and talking to DJs who've been kind enough to play my recordings.
      I am planning on releasing my 6th record in the spring of 2017 entitled "Dreamland".
      I'm back in school studying web developement to work one day for an educational organization who needs a coder to help develop some great curriculum for the students of the world.</p>
